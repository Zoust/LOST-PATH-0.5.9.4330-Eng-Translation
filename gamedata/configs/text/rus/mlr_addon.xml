	<text>Look here: 'syndicate' in the Area has only one Central base - our. South cut trail again, the psi setting on the Amber works the crowd at times zombar rod out in the arms of the mutants.

	<string id="aslan_st_3">
	<text>as for the hazards - assess yourself, but keep in mind that when you fulfill orders - you're at work and feelings with snot throw a fuck or put it on a shelf, no morality - only calculation. About trails through Limansk is the safest in terms of displacement. There is a closed space, the sniper's possible you can't fully shelter from the ejection, and in case of a prolonged firefight. There are also disadvantages - it is the unpredictability of the terrain, I don't know what's around the corner.</text>

Their captain (the late General) simply cut off communication with the headquarters. This infuriated the local stalking, exactly as puzzled by some enemy fighters.
