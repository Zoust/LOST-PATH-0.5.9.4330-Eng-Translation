A quiet, almost inaudible shot and a huge range of the aiming shot make this rifle almost perfect sniper weapons. the effective range of the L115A3 is 1400 meters. Such an increase in the range of fire justified the choice of a 25-fold optical sight 'Schmidt and Bender' instead of a 12-fold sight, which is mounted on rifles L96. In this configuration it is capable of destroying the target with one shot at any temperature and even with a contaminated barrel.</text>
