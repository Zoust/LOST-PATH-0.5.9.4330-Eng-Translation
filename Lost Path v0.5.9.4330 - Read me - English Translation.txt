Please write to the group about the found bugs and exploits. The more information, the better.

You selected RePack without compression. The installation time is 1.5 - 5 minutes. Requires a minimum of resources, but the weight of 26GB makes itself felt.

After installing the repack, you must put the files from the Patch folder in the root of the game, so that the _mods folders merge.
For correct work, I advise you to install an update from the Update folder. Check the current version in the client's version.ini file
and updates, if not coincide - be updated!

I advise you not to use SWTC CoC, since this addon causes strong overexposures and distortion of normal colors of objects. how
the alternative is better to use "Skyboxes (put 1)" before the addon with the name "(put 3)" - this adaptation of SkyGod to Lost Path,
or any of the others provided in the _mods folder. Have a good game!

USE OF THIRD-GAME ARCHIVES IS PROHIBITED.
USE FILES THAT ARE EXTENDED BY THE AUTHOR.

the squad will spawn. And more than the capacity of a smart can not be ensured. Even if the smart does not belong to you, you can
cause reinforcements in the smart closest to you. If there are enemies there, reinforcements will help you. If you are waiting for reinforcements, then

from the caches when creating the game). Now, when creating a game, the caches are not created and the loot in them appears already when the hiding place is hidden. Capacity
(the quantity and quality of things inside) depends on the level of the player, the level of his luck (by default, luck = 0, so at least to level it
you just need to download) and some basic part (which is available immediately so that the caches are not empty). The higher the level and the luck the more things you

This repack includes a fully working client
with version 0.5.007 without having to patch it
separately.

Also in this repack there is an OVT version of the next
update under the working title "build 296".
You can see the list of changes below.

The _mods folder contains optional additions to the
game. Also do not forget to visit the tab
"Mod settings", where you can more flexibly configure
game process. I advise not to use SWTC CoC because
that there wild outbreaks sometimes happen + it is necessary through
console configure lumscale.

More details about the modifications in the official group:

Using all my know-how in a supporter
projects is prohibited. Any attempt to copy or
"pizdings" will be regarded as theft.

Collaboration with third-party developers on
mutually beneficial soil is only welcomed.

With Respect, Draco.
